# Knights-Travails

This repository contains an algorithm which gives us the possible movement done by a Knight on a chessboard. The moves made by knight was represented with the help of a graph. Breadth First Search Algorithm was used to show the shortest possible way to get from one position to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
